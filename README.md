# SecretSolver

This Java program reconstructs the original secret from a set of shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme. It reads input from a JSON file with arbitrary bases (binary, octal, decimal, hex, etc.), evaluates the values, applies Lagrange interpolation on all k-combinations of shares, and outputs the most probable original secret while eliminating incorrect shares.

ðŸ“¦ Features
Parses dynamic JSON input (n, k, and shares in various bases)

Evaluates share expressions to base-10 BigIntegers

Tries all combinations of k shares from n

Reconstructs (k-1)-degree polynomial using Lagrange interpolation

Identifies the most frequently reconstructed secret

Detects and eliminates incorrect shares

Handles arbitrarily large numbers
